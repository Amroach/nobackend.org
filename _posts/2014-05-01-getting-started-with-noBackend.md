I have been extremely interested in the noBackend/Static/Front-End Driven applications ever since I was introduced to them by Gregor (@gr2m) roughly a year ago. It was fascinating to me that, as a front-end dev, I could build dynamic, multi-user apps that syncs data in realtime and doesn't bork when offline without any backend knowledge. No more would I sludge through PHP documentation just to figure out how to send mail from my personal site contact form because Dreamcode was in the works!

While I was an extreme advocate for using [Hoodie](http://hood.ie) and other Backends as a Service, or BaaS, technologies like [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) to build awesome web apps, I had yet to find the time to actually give it a shot myself until recently. I got the opportunity to speak about these services to a local front-end meetup, so I decided to make it more of a technical talk rather than a high level overview and build a demo app to go along with the presentation. I built two versions of the same app, one using Firebase and the other using Hoodie, to showcase the commercial v. open-source options in this field.

The app, Troopr, is your basic CRUD application for viewing and sharing biking tips on the web. It had the usual email/password authentication for signing up and logging into the app. As a testament to the power of these technologies and not my coding prowess, I built these two apps in just two days without any prior experience in building web apps.You can take a look at the code and pull down the [repo](https://github.com/HipsterBrown/FDA-demos) from my GitHub to run the demos.
